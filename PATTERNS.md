When application developers design and deploy software systems, they often follow established IT infrastructure patterns to ensure scalability, reliability, security, and performance. Below are the top 10 most common IT infrastructure patterns used by developers:

### 1. **Monolithic Architecture**
   - **Description:** A traditional approach where the entire application (frontend, backend, and database) is packaged and deployed as a single unit.
   - **Use case:** Simple applications or small teams that require low complexity in deployment.
   - **Pros:** Easier to develop initially, simple deployment, centralized management.
   - **Cons:** Difficult to scale, maintain, and update as the application grows.

### 2. **Microservices Architecture**
   - **Description:** A modular architecture where an application is broken down into small, independently deployable services, each responsible for a specific business function.
   - **Use case:** Large-scale applications that require scalability, flexibility, and frequent updates.
   - **Pros:** Scalability, fault isolation, flexibility, continuous delivery.
   - **Cons:** Increased complexity, requires strong DevOps practices, inter-service communication challenges.

### 3. **Serverless Computing**
   - **Description:** Developers write functions that are executed in response to events (e.g., HTTP requests, file uploads) without managing server infrastructure.
   - **Use case:** Event-driven, short-duration workloads, and applications requiring fast time-to-market.
   - **Pros:** No server management, auto-scaling, cost-efficient for intermittent workloads.
   - **Cons:** Cold start latency, limited execution time, potential vendor lock-in.

### 4. **Containerization (Docker, Kubernetes)**
   - **Description:** Application components are packaged into lightweight, portable containers. Tools like Docker and Kubernetes help in creating, deploying, and managing containerized applications.
   - **Use case:** Scalable, isolated environments for applications, microservices, and cloud-native architectures.
   - **Pros:** Consistent environments, portability, scalability.
   - **Cons:** Complexity in orchestration and management, security considerations.

### 5. **Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)**
   - **Description:** The application is designed to react to events (such as user actions, system changes, or external triggers), which propagate through a messaging system (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ).
   - **Use case:** Real-time systems, asynchronous processing, and systems requiring decoupling.
   - **Pros:** Decoupled components, scalability, real-time processing.
   - **Cons:** Eventual consistency challenges, complexity in debugging, increased dependency management.

### 6. **Hybrid Cloud Architecture**
   - **Description:** An infrastructure pattern where applications are deployed across both on-premises and public/private cloud environments, enabling flexibility and scalability.
   - **Use case:** Organizations with existing on-premises infrastructure looking to gradually migrate to the cloud.
   - **Pros:** Flexibility, cost-efficiency, regulatory compliance.
   - **Cons:** Increased complexity in management, network latency issues.

### 7. **Cloud-Native Architecture**

   - **Use case:** High-traffic applications requiring fault tolerance and efficient resource utilization.
   - **Pros:** High availability, fault tolerance, performance optimization.
   - **Cons:** Complexity in configuration and management, potential single points of failure.

### 9. **Data-Centric Architecture**
   - **Description:** The application is built with a focus on data processing and storage. Data is the primary driver, and components are optimized for data ingestion, processing, and storage (e.g., ETL pipelines, real-time analytics).
   - **Use case:** Big data applications, analytics platforms, and systems requiring real-time data processing.
   - **Pros:** High data throughput, optimized for large-scale data operations.
   - **Cons:** High infrastructure costs, complex data management.

### 10. **Distributed Systems Architecture**
   - **Description:** The application is split across multiple machines, either locally or across a network, to ensure fault tolerance, scalability, and performance.
   - **Use case:** High-availability systems, large-scale applications requiring redundancy and fault tolerance.
   - **Pros:** Scalability, fault tolerance, improved resource utilization.
   - **Cons:** Complex deployment, increased latency, network partitioning challenges.

### Conclusion:
These infrastructure patterns are not mutually exclusive, and developers often combine them to meet the specific requirements of the application. For example, a cloud-native application might also leverage microservices and serverless computing. The key is selecting patterns that best align with the application’s needs for scalability, performance, and reliability.

### 1. **Client-Server Architecture**
   - **Description:** A traditional model where clients request services and resources from a centralized server. The server processes these requests and sends the required responses.
   - **Use case:** Desktop applications, legacy enterprise systems, and environments with defined client-server roles.
   - **Pros:** Centralized management, easy to control and secure.
   - **Cons:** Single point of failure, scalability issues as the number of clients grows.

### 2. **Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Architecture**
   - **Description:** In this model, each node in the network can act as both a client and a server, sharing resources with other peers without relying on a central server.
   - **Use case:** File sharing, distributed computing, decentralized applications (e.g., torrent networks).
   - **Pros:** High fault tolerance, no single point of failure, scalability.
   - **Cons:** Complexity in ensuring data consistency, security concerns.

### 3. **Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)**
   - **Description:** A design pattern where software components are organized as loosely coupled services that communicate over a network, often using protocols like SOAP or REST.
   - **Use case:** Large enterprise systems where different services must communicate independently while being part of a larger business process.
   - **Pros:** Reusability, flexibility, interoperability between different technologies.
   - **Cons:** Complexity in service management, potential performance overhead, and governance challenges.

### 4. **Active-Passive Failover (High Availability)**
